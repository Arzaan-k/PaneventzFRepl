2. Multer middleware processes files on backend
3. Files are stored in local uploads directory
4. File paths are stored in database for reference
5. Images are served via Express static middleware

### Cloudinary Integration
- **Media Page**: Fetches images from actual Cloudinary folders using correct API endpoints
- **Event Galleries**: Displays organized event photography from 16 different event folders
